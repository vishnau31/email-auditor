The project is progressing well and we're on track to meet our deadline. 

I've completed the initial phase of development and the code review is scheduled for next week. The testing team has been briefed and they're ready to begin their work once the development phase is complete.

We should have the final documentation ready by Friday, and I'll send you a copy for review. The presentation materials are also being prepared and will be available for the stakeholder meeting.

Let me know if you need any additional information or have questions about the current status.

Thanks,
Sarah
