Hello there!

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our discussion from last week regarding the upcoming project deadline. 

As we discussed, we need to ensure that all deliverables are completed by the end of this month. This includes the final documentation, code review, and testing phases. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to help move things forward. I'm available for a call tomorrow afternoon if you'd like to discuss this further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
John
