}
```

## Available Rules

### GreetingRule
Checks for appropriate email greetings (Dear, Hello, Hi, etc.)

### AttachmentRule
Verifies presence of image attachments for visual content

### LengthRule
Ensures email content is neither too short nor too long

## Development

### Project Structure

- **EML Parser**: Handles .eml file parsing with support for multipart MIME
- **Rule Registry**: Dynamic rule discovery and management system
- **Audit Engine**: Orchestrates rule execution and scoring
- **Report Generator**: Creates structured audit reports

### Adding New Rules

1. Create a new rule class in `app/rules/`
2. Inherit from `BaseRule`
3. Implement the `evaluate` method
4. The rule will be automatically discovered and loaded

Example:
```python
from app.rules.base import BaseRule
from app.models import EmailMessage

class CustomRule(BaseRule):
    name = "CustomRule"
    description = "Custom email quality check"
    
    def evaluate(self, email: EmailMessage) -> RuleResult:
        # Your rule logic here
        pass
```
